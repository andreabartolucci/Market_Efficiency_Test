# Market_Efficiency_Test
This repository contains a script that performs a range of market efficiency tests for financial assets. The tests are based on Eugene Fama's classification of market efficiency into three levels: weak-form efficiency, semi-strong efficiency, and strong-form efficiency.

The script utilizes the Yahoo Finance API to download financial data for analysis. It then performs data manipulation and cleaning processes to prepare the dataset. The repository focuses on conducting market efficiency tests specifically on DOGECOIN (crypto) and GM (stock).

By exploring this repository, you will find a comprehensive script that enables you to examine the efficiency of financial markets using various tests. These tests provide insights into the extent to which market prices reflect all available information.

Enhance your understanding of market efficiency testing by accessing this repository on GitHub. Explore the script, analyze the data, and gain valuable insights into the efficiency of the DOGECOIN and GM markets.
